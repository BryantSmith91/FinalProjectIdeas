# Ideas for Final Project - Data Boot Camp

## Making a Game of Snake and Having it Played by a Neural Network
* Collect Game Data - > Store and Display raw data in DataFrame + CSV - > Plot in Matplotlib or Tableau

### Possible DataFrame Columns

* GameID (comes from csv/dataframe gameid.max+1)
* totalsteps (game length)
* total_presses
* left_presses
* right_presses
* up_presses
* down_presses
* apple_start_x
* apple_start_y
* apple_end_x
* apple_end_y
* snakehead_end_x
* snakehead_end_y
* game_end_reason (snake, wall, or player interrupted)
* total_score
* human_player?
 
#### Tensorflow to play
#### KNN or other Classifier to classify if human or Neural Network Player

# Ideas for Presentation

* Ask for volunteer to play a game of snake?
* Project started as looking to build a Machine Learning model to play smash bros, didn't think 2 weeks was going to be enough time.  Still want to do it, if anyone else is interested let Kendal or I know
* AI play game of Snake
* Show raw code
* show website with data in table or tableau
* website has tableau dashboards
